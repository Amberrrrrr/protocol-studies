# A Brief Introduction to Elliptic Curve Cryptography

Cryptography can often seem like an abstract and theoretical field, but its applications are deeply woven into the fabric of our everyday lives. Let's consider a real-world scenario to understand how cryptography, specifically Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), can be used to safeguard critical interactions.

Alice, a diligent businesswoman, has been abducted and held captive on a remote island. Her captors demand a hefty ransom of $1 million for her release. With limited options for communication, they provide a single postcard for her to instruct her associate, Bob, to transfer the funds.

Alice considers writing the ransom amount and signing the postcard like a check. However, this method poses a significant risk: the kidnappers could easily forge the postcard, inflate the amount, and deceive Bob into sending them more money.

Alice needs a robust approach that allows:

1. Bob to verify that the transfer has be authorized by her, and
2. ensure that postcard's message has not been tampered with.

The goal of this exercise is device a method for Alice to create a **secret key üîë** known only to her. This key will be crucial for her to prove her identity and ensure the message's authenticity to Bob.

Mathematics, as always, comes to the rescue. Through ingenious use of **Elliptic Curves**, let's explore how Alice can generate the secret key.

# Elliptic curves

An elliptic curve is a curve¬†**described by the equation**:

$$
y^2 = x^3 + ax+b
$$

Examples:

Observe that elliptic curves are symmetric about the x-axis.

Ethereum uses a standard curve known as [secp256k1](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf) with parameters $a=0$, and $b=7$; which is the curve:
$$y^2=x^3+7$$

# Fields

In mathematics, a **field** is a set $F$, containing at least two elements, which is closed under two binary operations usually referred to as **addition** ($+$), and **multiplication**($\times$). A set is closed under an operation when the result of the operation is also a member of the set.

The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ is a familiar example of field, since arithmetic addition of two real numbers is closed.

$$
 3 \in \mathbb{R},  5 \in \mathbb{R} \\
 3 + 5 = 8 \in \mathbb{R}
$$

Elliptic curves are interesting because the points form a field, the result of "addition" of two points remains on the curve. This geometric addition, distinct from arithmetic counterparts, involves drawing a line through chosen points (**P** and **Q**) and reflecting the resulting curve intersection(**R'**) across the x-axis to yield their sum (**R**).

A point (**P**) to can also be added to itself($P+P$), in which case the straight line becomes a tangent to P that reflects the sum (**2P**).

Repeated point-addition is known as **scalar multiplication**:

$$
nP = \underbrace{P + P + \cdots + P}_{n\ \text{times}}
$$

# Discrete logarithm problem

Let's leverage scalar multiplication to generate the **secret key üîë**. This key, denoted by $k$, represents the number of times a base point $P$ is added to itself, yielding the resulting public point $Q$:

$$
Q = k*P
$$

Given $Q$ and $P$ it is possible derive the secret key $k$ by effectively reversing the multiplication, similar to the **logarithm problem**.

We need to ensure that scalar multiplication does not leak our **secret key üîë**. That is scalar multiplication should be "easy" one way and "untraceable" the other way around.

The analogy of a clock helps illustrate the desired one-way nature. Imagine a task starting at 12 noon and ending at 3. Knowing only the final time (3) makes it impossible to determine the exact duration without additional information. This is because **modular arithmetic** introduces a "wrap-around" effect. The task could have taken 3 hours, 15 hours, or even 27 hours, all resulting in the same final time modulo 12.

Over modulo prime number, this is especially hard and is known as **discrete logarithm problem**.
