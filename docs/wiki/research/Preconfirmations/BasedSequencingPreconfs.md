# Ethereum Based Sequencing with Preconfirmations

## [Overview](#overview)

Ethereum's evolving ecosystem is set to introduce new paradigms for rollups and chain interactions, emphasizing seamless transitions and enhanced user experiences. This wiki article introduces a framework for Ethereum sequencing and pre-onfirmations, originally proposed by Justin Drake[^1][^4], a step toward realizing this vision, offering a unified platform for all Ethereum chains and rollups.

### [United Chains of Ethereum](#united-chains-of-ethereum)

The vision for Ethereum is not just a network of isolated chains but a cohesive ecosystem where all rollups and chains coexist without friction, termed the "United Chains of Ethereum." This concept envisions a scenario where users can move between different states (rollups) with ease, akin to crossing state lines without the need for passports or the imposition of tariffs. Such an environment would not only enhance user experience but also foster a more integrated and efficient blockchain ecosystem.

### [Ethereum's Services for Rollups](#ethereums-services-for-rollups)

- **Current Services:** Ethereum currently provides two critical services to rollups: settlement and data availability. These services lay the foundation for rollups to operate effectively on Ethereum's decentralized platform.

- **Introduction of Ethereum Sequencing:** Ethereum sequencing, is proposed to complement the existing ones, offering a new resource that rollups can leverage to further optimize their operations. Although sequencing has always been inherent to Ethereum, its potential as a dedicated service for rollups represents an innovative application, akin to the adaptive use of core data for new functionalities.
