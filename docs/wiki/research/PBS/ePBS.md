# Envisioning Ethereum's Future: The Path to Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS)

## [DRAFT MODE - This is work in progress.]

## [ELI5](#eli5)

Imagine Ethereum as a busy city where builders create buildings (blocks) on plots of land given by city planners (proposers). Right now, a few big companies have most of the control over building, which isn’t ideal for our city's future. The document talks about making this process part of the city’s rules, so everyone has a fair chance to build. It’s like making sure the city grows in a way that’s best for everyone, not just the big players.

## [TLDR](#tldr)

Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS) refers to integrating the PBS mechanism directly into the Ethereum blockchain protocol itself, rather than having it operate through external services or add-ons. This integration aims to formalize and standardize the separation between the roles of block proposers and block builders within the core protocol rules, enhancing the system's efficiency, security, and decentralization.

## [Introduction - What is PBS](#introduction---what-is-pbs)

Proposer-Builder Separation (PBS) is a design philosophy[quote Barnable here] and mechanism in blockchain networks, particularly within the context of Ethereum, that aims to decouple the roles of proposing blocks (proposers) and constructing the content of those blocks (builders). This separation addresses various challenges and inefficiencies associated with block production, especially in proof-of-stake (PoS) systems and in the context of maximizing extractable value (MEV).

Here’s a breakdown of the roles and the rationale behind PBS:

### [Proposers](#proposers)
- **Role**: Validators chosen by the protocol to propose a new block to the blockchain.
- **Traditional Challenge**: In a system without PBS, the proposer must both select which transactions to include in a block and order them. This task becomes increasingly complex and specialized as the proposer needs to understand the current state of the blockchain deeply and identify the most profitable transactions to include, often related to MEV.

### [Builders](#builders)
- **Role**: Specialized actors responsible for constructing blocks. They listen to the network for transactions, order them in a way that maximizes the value extracted from the block (MEV), and bid for their block to be chosen by the proposer.
- **Rationale**: Builders are specialized and equipped with sophisticated strategies and algorithms to efficiently order transactions to maximize MEV. Their specialization allows for more efficient and profitable block construction than a generalist proposer could achieve.

### [Separation Benefits](#separation-benefits)
- **Decentralization and Security**: By allowing proposers to remain unsophisticated entities, PBS aids in maintaining a more decentralized network. It lowers the barrier to entry for becoming a proposer, as they no longer need the infrastructure or knowledge to optimize transaction ordering for MEV.
- **Efficiency and Specialization**: Separating the roles allows each actor to specialize in their respective tasks, leading to more efficient block construction and potentially higher network throughput.
- **Fairness and MEV Distribution**: PBS can help in creating a more competitive and fair environment for MEV extraction, as multiple builders compete to have their blocks chosen by proposers.

PBS is fundamentally a recognition that different roles in the blockchain ecosystem can have distinct capabilities and incentives, and that separating these roles can lead to improved efficiency, security, and fairness (division of labor). This concept has been explored and implemented in various ways, including through external services like MEV-Boost in Ethereum, which facilitates the interaction between proposers and builders outside the core protocol.

## [Brief overview of ePBS](#brief-overview-of-epbs)

Enshrined Proposer-Builder Separation (ePBS) is a protocol-level enhancement for Ethereum that institutionalizes the division of labor between block proposers and block builders. Unlike the existing off-chain solutions like MEV-Boost, which operate on a trust-based model with relays, ePBS integrates this separation directly into Ethereum's core protocol, aiming to streamline and secure the process.

The key difference between ePBS and current mechanisms like MEV-Boost lies in the protocol's direct support for the separation, eliminating the need for external relays to mediate the transaction. This enshrinement is designed to reduce trust requirements, enhance transparency, and improve overall network efficiency by formally defining the roles and interactions within the protocol itself.

In the ePBS framework:
- **Proposers** are validators responsible for proposing new blocks to the network. Their role is limited to choosing which block to propose, without the need to construct the block themselves.
- **Builders** are entities or algorithms that assemble blocks, optimizing the transaction order for profitability (e.g., maximizing MEV extraction) and offering these blocks to proposers through a transparent auction mechanism.
- **Relays**, in the traditional MEV-Boost context, serve as intermediaries that facilitate the communication between proposers and builders. Under ePBS, the reliance on external relays is diminished or redefined, as the protocol itself facilitates the direct interaction between proposers and builders.

The need to enshrine PBS into Ethereum's protocol stems from the desire to mitigate risks associated with external, trust-dependent services, improve the decentralization and security of block production, and better manage the complexities around MEV extraction. By formalizing these roles within the Ethereum protocol, ePBS seeks to ensure a fair, efficient, and transparent process for transaction ordering and block construction, aligned with Ethereum's ethos of decentralization and open participation.


### [PBS in historical context](#pbs-in-historical-context)

- **Pre-MEV-Geth Era:** Before MEV-Geth, there was a form of PBS in the division of labor between a mining pool operator and the workers. The mining pool operator would construct the block body, and the workers would hash the block further. This division of labor also involved a commit-reveal scheme 
 
- **Before the Merge (Proof of Work Era):** The concept of PBS was more explicit in the MEV-Geth world, where a few large mining pools controlled a significant portion of the hash rate. MEV-Geth allowed searchers to send bundles to miners without worrying about the miners stealing them, as the miners' reputation was worth more than the potential gain from stealing the contents of the bundle. This interaction was simpler due to the fewer number of block producers. 

- **Approaching the Merge:** As the merge approached, there was significant discussion about PBS as a general approach. The idea was considered for inclusion in the merge hard fork, but it was eventually discarded due to the complexity it would add to the software and specification, which could slow down the merge process.

- **Introduction of MEV-Boost:**
 - **April 2022:** Stefan from Flashbots posted the original MEV-Boost specification, outlining how proposers could interact with an external block-building network. Work began in the background at the Devconnect meeting on MEV-Day in Amsterdam in '22, finalizing all necessary APIs.
 - **Summer 2022:** Efforts were made to deliver a permissionless relay on open-source software, allowing other relay operators to run it. This was completed just in time for the merge, which included permissionless builder access.

- **MEV-Boost as a Software Solution:** MEV-Boost facilitates the auction between the proposer and the builder, ensuring that the block produced by the builder is valid and accurately pays the proposer. This is achieved through a relay that sits between the proposer and the builder, facilitating the auction process.

- **Current Status Post-Merge:** Immediately after the merge, there were about three or four relays running. Now, there are around 8-10 relays that facilitate most of the MEV-Boost blocks. About 95% of validators are connected to one of these relays and use their connection to source their block production.

 
### [Transition from mev-boost to ePBS](#transition-from-mev-boost-to-epbs)
The transition from MEV-Boost to ePBS represents a pivotal evolution in Ethereum's approach to handling Miner/Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) and improving the network's efficiency and fairness. Here's a detailed look into this transition:

**MEV-Boost: A Precursor to ePBS**
MEV-Boost, introduced as an interim solution, allows validators to outsource the construction of blocks to external builders, who bid for the right to propose block contents. This setup created a marketplace for block space, reducing the negative impacts of MEV by making the process more competitive and transparent. However, MEV-Boost operates off-chain and relies on centralized relays, introducing potential centralization and security risks.


**The Need for Transition**
While MEV-Boost marked a significant advancement in mitigating some aspects of MEV, it highlighted the need for a more robust, decentralized solution integrated directly into the Ethereum protocol. Key concerns with MEV-Boost include:
- **Relay Centralization**: Dependence on a few relays risks centralization and single points of failure.
- **Security Risks**: Off-chain operations could be susceptible to manipulation or attacks not covered by the protocol's security guarantees.
- **Limited Validator Control**: Validators have less control over block content, potentially affecting network censorship resistance and fairness.


**Envisioning ePBS**
ePBS aims to address these issues by formalizing the separation of proposers and builders within the Ethereum protocol itself. This entails:
- **Protocol-Level Integration**: By moving the auction and selection mechanism for block construction into the protocol, ePBS ensures all operations are subject to Ethereum's consensus rules and security guarantees.
- **Decentralization**: ePBS reduces reliance on centralized relays by allowing a decentralized network of builders to submit block proposals directly to validators.
- **Increased Security and Fairness**: With the process enshrined in the protocol, the potential for manipulation decreases, enhancing the overall security and fairness of block construction.


**Technical Changes for ePBS**
Transitioning to ePBS requires significant technical changes to the Ethereum protocol, including:
- **New Consensus Mechanisms**: Adjustments to the consensus layer to accommodate the separate roles of proposers and builders, ensuring they can interact securely and efficiently.
- **Smart Contract and Off-Chain Components**: Development of new smart contracts and off-chain infrastructure to manage the auction process, builder registration, and bid submissions.
- **Adjustments to Validator Operations**: Validators need to adapt their operations to participate in the ePBS framework, requiring updates to client software and operational practices.


**Challenges and Considerations**
The transition involves several challenges, such as ensuring the system's resilience to new forms of MEV exploitation, maintaining network performance amid the added complexity, and achieving broad consensus within the Ethereum community on the ePBS implementation details.

Moving from MEV-Boost to ePBS is a complex but necessary step towards a more decentralized, secure, and efficient Ethereum. It represents a move from a practical workaround to a foundational redesign of how Ethereum handles block proposal and construction, aiming to mitigate MEV's adverse effects while upholding the network's core principles. This transition is crucial for Ethereum's scalability and sustainability as it continues to evolve and accommodate growing demand.


## [The Case for ePBS](#the-case-for-epbs)

The transition to ePBS from the current MEV-Boost system is motivated by several key reasons that align with Ethereum's core values of decentralization, security, and efficiency. Proponents of ePBS highlight the importance of integrating PBS directly into the Ethereum protocol to address several concerns arising from the reliance on relays and out-of-protocol mechanisms for block construction. Here's a detailed explanation of these aspects:

### [Main Reasons for Transition to ePBS](#main-reasons-for-transition-to-epbs)
1. **Decentralization**: ePBS aims to reduce the reliance on a few centralized relays by embedding the PBS mechanism directly within the Ethereum protocol. This move seeks to distribute the responsibility for block construction across a broader set of participants, enhancing the network's resilience and reducing central points of failure.
2. **Security**: By integrating PBS into the Ethereum protocol, ePBS ensures that the entire block construction process is governed by the same consensus rules and security guarantees that protect other aspects of the network. This contrasts with the current system, where off-chain relays operate without the direct oversight of Ethereum's consensus mechanisms.
3. **Efficiency and Fairness**: ePBS proposes to create a more transparent and competitive marketplace for block space, potentially reducing the inefficiencies and inequities associated with MEV extraction. It aims to ensure that validators have more control and visibility over the blocks they propose, contributing to a fairer distribution of MEV rewards.

### [Contradiction of Core Values by Reliance on Relays](#contradiction-of-core-values-by-reliance-on-relays)
- **Centralization Risks**: The current reliance on a limited number of relays introduces centralization into a network that prizes decentralization as a core principle. Centralized relays can become single points of failure or control, undermining the network's distributed nature.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: External relays, operating outside of Ethereum's consensus rules, could potentially be manipulated or attacked, posing security risks to the network. This external dependency contradicts Ethereum's goal of achieving robust, protocol-enshrined security.

### [Perceived Risks and Inefficiencies with Out-of-Protocol PBS](#perceived-risks-and-inefficiencies-with-out-of-protocol-pbs)
- **MEV-Related Manipulations**: The current PBS mechanism, reliant on external relays, may not adequately protect against manipulative practices associated with MEV extraction, leading to unfair advantages and potential network instability.
- **Opaque Operations**: The operation of relays outside the Ethereum protocol can lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, making it difficult to monitor and regulate block construction practices effectively.

### [Sustainability Concerns of Relays](#sustainability-concerns-of-relays)
- **Operational Sustainability**: The long-term operational viability of relays is uncertain, as they depend on continuous participation and support from the community. Any disruption in relay services could significantly impact the network's ability to process transactions efficiently.
- **Financial Model**: The financial sustainability of relays is also a concern. If the costs of running relays exceed the revenue generated from their operation, it could lead to a reduction in the number of relays, increasing centralization risks and affecting the competitive marketplace for block space.

The transition towards ePBS involves critical economic and security considerations, especially in the context of Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and proposals like MEV burn. These considerations shape the debate around ePBS, highlighting its potential impact on the Ethereum ecosystem. Here's an exploration of these aspects:

### [Economic Considerations](#economic-considerations)
1. **MEV Distribution**: One of the primary economic concerns revolves around how MEV is distributed among validators, builders, and users. ePBS aims to create a more transparent and equitable MEV market by ensuring that validators are fairly compensated for the blocks they propose. This could potentially alter the current dynamics, where certain participants may disproportionately benefit from MEV.
2. **Market Efficiency**: By integrating PBS directly into the Ethereum protocol, ePBS is expected to foster a more competitive and efficient marketplace for block space. This could lead to better pricing mechanisms for transaction inclusion, benefiting users with fairer transaction costs and potentially reducing the prevalence of gas price auctions that lead to network congestion.
3. **Sustainability of Relays**: ePBS addresses the operational and financial sustainability concerns of relays by potentially reducing their role in the MEV extraction process. A protocol-level solution could offer a more stable and predictable framework for handling MEV, alleviating the need for external relays and their associated costs.

### [Security Considerations](#security-considerations)
1. **Centralization Risks**: The current reliance on a limited set of MEV-Boost relays introduces centralization risks, making the network more vulnerable to attacks or manipulations. ePBS seeks to mitigate these risks by decentralizing the process of block proposal and construction, aligning with Ethereum's security ethos.
2. **Manipulative Practices**: External relays and opaque MEV extraction mechanisms can lead to manipulative practices, such as transaction reordering or sandwich attacks, that undermine network integrity. ePBS aims to provide a more regulated and transparent environment for handling MEV, enhancing overall network security.
3. **Protocol-Enshrined Security**: Incorporating PBS directly into the Ethereum protocol ensures that block construction adheres to the same rigorous consensus and security standards that govern other aspects of the network. This unified approach to security is seen as a significant improvement over the current system, where external components like relays operate without direct protocol oversight.

### [MEV Burn](#mev-burn)
The concept of MEV burn involves redirecting a portion of MEV profits towards burning Ether, reducing the overall supply and potentially increasing the value of the remaining Ether. This mechanism has been proposed as a way to align the interests of validators, builders, and the wider Ethereum community by ensuring that excessive MEV extraction does not lead to inflationary pressures or disproportionate benefits for certain network participants.

1. **Inflationary Pressure Mitigation**: By burning a part of the MEV, Ethereum could potentially control inflationary pressures arising from new Ether issuance for block rewards.
2. **Economic Stability**: MEV burn could contribute to the economic stability of Ethereum by ensuring that the benefits of MEV extraction are more evenly distributed across the ecosystem, including Ether holders who are not directly involved in MEV strategies.
3. **Alignment of Incentives**: Implementing an MEV burn mechanism could help align the incentives of various network participants, ensuring that the pursuit of MEV does not compromise network security or efficiency.

The transition to ePBS from the current MEV-Boost system is driven by a combination of economic and security considerations, including concerns about MEV distribution, market efficiency, centralization risks, and the operational sustainability of relays. The potential implementation of an MEV burn mechanism further reflects Ethereum's commitment to aligning economic incentives with its core values of decentralization, security, and efficiency. This transition marks a pivotal moment in Ethereum's evolution, potentially reshaping the landscape of transaction ordering and MEV extraction in favor of a more secure, efficient, and equitable ecosystem.


## [Counterarguments to ePBS](#counterarguments-to-epbs)

The discussion around the enshrinement of PBS (ePBS) within Ethereum's protocol has stirred significant debate, with various counterarguments presented by its critics [quote the Mike's talk with uncommon core]. Proponents of ePBS, however, offer robust responses to these concerns, advocating for its necessity and integration into Ethereum's roadmap. Additionally, the discourse explores alternative methods for addressing miner extractable value (MEV), weighing their sufficiency against the proposed ePBS system.

### [Primary Counterarguments Against ePBS](#primary-counterarguments-against-epbs)

1. **Complexity and Technical Risk**: Critics argue that incorporating ePBS into Ethereum's core protocol significantly increases its complexity and introduces new technical risks, potentially jeopardizing network stability and security.

2. **Network Performance Concerns**: There is apprehension that ePBS could impact Ethereum's network performance, specifically relating to latency and block propagation times, which could, in turn, affect transaction processing efficiency.

3. **Reduced Flexibility for Validators**: Some contend that ePBS might limit validators' flexibility in choosing block proposals, potentially centralizing decision-making power among a few large builders.

4. **Premature Optimization**: Skeptics suggest that focusing on ePBS might be a case of premature optimization, diverting attention and resources from more pressing issues on Ethereum's roadmap.

5. **Bypassability**: Bypassability refers to the ability of participants within the Ethereum ecosystem—be it validators, proposers, builders, or others—to sidestep or bypass the rules and mechanisms established by ePBS. This could occur through off-protocol agreements, alternative transaction ordering systems, or other means that effectively operate outside the constraints set by ePBS. The protocol will have no easy way to enforce ePBS rules on them. 

### [If it ain't broke, don't fix it - counterarguments](#if-it-aint-broke-dont-fix-it---counterarguments)

The "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" perspective emerges as a significant counterargument against the ePBS within Ethereum's protocol. This viewpoint is grounded in caution and a preference for maintaining the status quo unless there's an unequivocal necessity for change. Here’s how this perspective shapes the counterarguments against ePBS:

**Reliance on Existing Systems**

Critics holding this perspective argue that the current mechanisms for handling MEV, including MEV-Boost and the relay system, have proven functional and effective in their operational context. They suggest that these systems have not only stabilized but also facilitated a certain equilibrium within Ethereum's ecosystem, balancing efficiency, security, and validator autonomy without necessitating a profound protocol overhaul.

**Risk of Unintended Consequences**

A fundamental concern is the potential for unintended consequences that a significant alteration like ePBS might introduce to the network. This viewpoint highlights the complexity and interdependence within Ethereum's system, where modifications at the protocol level could precipitate unforeseen vulnerabilities, security risks, or compromises in network performance. The argument posits that the benefits of ePBS might not justify the risks associated with disrupting a functioning system.

**Development Focus and Resource Allocation**

From the "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" standpoint, the emphasis on developing and implementing ePBS might divert valuable resources and attention from other critical areas within Ethereum's ecosystem that require immediate attention or offer clearer benefits. Critics suggest that Ethereum's development focus should prioritize scalability solutions, Layer 2 enhancements, and other upgrades that directly contribute to user experience and network capacity without introducing the complexities associated with ePBS.

**The Challenge of Proving Necessity**

This perspective demands a higher standard of proof for the necessity of ePBS. Critics argue that for a change of this magnitude to be justified, it must be clear that existing systems are not merely suboptimal but fundamentally broken in a way that directly impedes Ethereum's operation or principles. The call for ePBS is seen as a solution seeking a problem, rather than a response to a critical need.

**Emphasizing Evolution Over Revolution**

Finally, the "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" argument is rooted in a preference for evolutionary rather than revolutionary changes within the Ethereum protocol. Proponents of this view prefer incremental improvements and optimizations to existing systems over wholesale architectural changes, advocating for a cautious approach that values stability and predictability.


### [Proponents' Responses and Advocacy for ePBS](#proponents-responses-and-advocacy-for-epbs)

1. **Mitigating Complexity and Technical Risk**: ePBS advocates argue that while the proposal introduces new elements to the protocol, these are manageable and outweighed by the benefits of enhanced fairness, security, and MEV distribution efficiency. Rigorous testing and phased implementation are proposed to mitigate risks.

2. **Addressing Network Performance**: Proponents maintain that ePBS can be designed with network efficiency in mind, leveraging advancements in technology and protocol engineering to minimize any adverse effects on latency or block propagation.

3. **Enhancing Validator Decision-Making**: ePBS supporters argue that by structuring the builder market more transparently and competitively, validators will actually have more informed choices, not less, promoting healthier decentralization.

4. **Strategic Importance on the Roadmap**: ePBS is considered by its advocates as not merely an optimization but a foundational improvement to Ethereum's economic and security models. It addresses pressing concerns related to MEV extraction practices and aligns with Ethereum's long-term goals of decentralization and scalability.

**Alternatives to ePBS and Their Evaluation**

1. **Improved MEV-Boost and Relays**: Some suggest that refining the existing MEV-Boost system and enhancing relay operations could address many of the concerns ePBS aims to solve, without necessitating protocol-level changes.

2. **MEV Burn Mechanisms**: Another alternative is the implementation of MEV burn mechanisms, where a portion of MEV profits is burned, potentially reducing the incentive for manipulative practices.

3. **Layer 2 Solutions and Decentralized Relays**: Exploring layer 2 solutions for transaction ordering or developing decentralized relay networks are also proposed as ways to mitigate MEV issues without altering the core protocol.

ePBS proponents argue that while these alternatives offer partial solutions, they do not comprehensively address the root issues of fairness, security, and decentralization that ePBS aims to solve. Moreover, they maintain that ePBS is a strategic enhancement that supports Ethereum's long-term vision, arguing for its prioritization amidst other developments.

The debate over ePBS encapsulates a broader discussion about Ethereum's future direction, balancing innovation with caution. While counterarguments emphasize risks and alternatives, ePBS advocates underline its alignment with Ethereum's core principles and its necessity for ensuring a fair, secure, and efficient blockchain ecosystem.



## [Designing ePBS](#designing-epbs)

### [Desirable properties of ePBS mechanisms](#desirable-properties-of-epbs-mechanisms)
The debate on the optimal ePBS mechanism and the concept of a minimum viable ePBS (MVePBS) revolves around identifying the core features and properties that such a system must possess to effectively address the challenges it aims to solve within the Ethereum ecosystem. This involves balancing the goals of decentralization, efficiency, security, and fairness, while also considering the practical implications of implementation and adoption. Here's a look at the central aspects of this debate and the properties considered essential for a minimum viable ePBS.

**Core Properties of MVePBS**

1. **Decentralization and Fair Access:** MVePBS must ensure that the process of proposing and building blocks remains decentralized, preventing any single entity from gaining disproportionate control or influence. This includes fair access to MEV opportunities and block space for all participants, maintaining Ethereum's ethos of decentralization.

2. **Security and Integrity:** The system should not compromise the security of the Ethereum network. This includes safeguarding against attacks that could arise from the separation of proposing and building roles, such as censorship, double-spending, or reordering attacks that could undermine the integrity of transactions.

3. **Efficiency and Scalability:** MVePBS should enhance, or at least not significantly detract from, the network's efficiency and scalability. This involves minimizing the added computational and communication overhead, ensuring that the system can scale with Ethereum's growth and increasing demand.

4. **Transparency and Predictability:** The mechanism should provide transparency in transaction ordering and block production, allowing participants to understand how decisions are made within the ePBS framework. This predictability helps in managing MEV in a way that is consistent and fair to all network users.

5. **Reduced Trust Requirements:** By enshrining PBS into the protocol, the system aims to reduce reliance on trust between different parties (e.g., between proposers and builders, or between users and relays). The design should minimize opportunities for off-protocol agreements that could bypass the intended fairness of the system.

6. **Fairness in MEV Distribution:** ePBS should aim to level the playing field regarding access to MEV, ensuring that opportunities for value extraction are fairly distributed among participants. This involves creating mechanisms that prevent monopolistic control over MEV opportunities by a few large players.

7. **Minimal Trust Assumptions:** The design should minimize the need for trust between proposers, builders, and validators. By enshrining PBS into the Ethereum protocol, ePBS mechanisms should leverage cryptographic and game-theoretic principles to ensure that participants can operate in a trust-minimized environment.

8. **Economic Viability:** ePBS mechanisms must be economically viable for all participants, including proposers, builders, and validators. This involves ensuring that the costs associated with participating in the ePBS ecosystem (e.g., staking requirements, transaction fees) do not outweigh the potential benefits, thus encouraging broad participation.

9. **Flexibility and Compatibility:** The ePBS framework should be flexible enough to accommodate future innovations and changes within the Ethereum ecosystem, including upgrades and new layer-2 solutions. It should also be compatible with existing infrastructure to facilitate a smooth transition.

10. **Reduced Complexity for Users:** While ePBS introduces additional complexity at the protocol level, it should strive to minimize the impact of this complexity on end-users and developers. The system should be designed so that interacting with Ethereum remains as intuitive and straightforward as possible.

11. **Incentive Alignment:** The incentives within the ePBS mechanism should be carefully designed to align the interests of all network participants, including users, proposers, builders, and validators. This alignment is crucial for ensuring the long-term health and stability of the network.


**Debating the Optimal Mechanism**

The debate on the optimal ePBS mechanism involves weighing various design choices against these core properties, often requiring trade-offs[quote the recent ePBS call from Ethereum]:

1. **Auction Mechanisms:** There's significant discussion around the best way to conduct auctions for block space and MEV opportunities—whether through second-price auctions, or more complex mechanisms like frequent batch auctions. Each has implications for fairness, efficiency, and vulnerability to manipulation.

2. **Builder Selection and Staking:** Deciding how builders are selected for proposing blocks—whether through staking, reputation systems, or randomized selection—impacts decentralization and security. Staking, for example, could provide economic security but might also centralize opportunities among wealthier participants.

3. **Inclusion and Censorship Resistance:** Ensuring the system resists censorship and includes transactions equitably is crucial. This may involve mechanisms for anonymous transaction submission or commitments to include certain transactions (e.g. Inclusion Lists), balancing against the potential for spam or malicious transactions.

4. **Compatibility and Adaptability:** The ePBS must be compatible with existing Ethereum infrastructure and adaptable to future changes to meet the raodmap, including upgrades like sharding or new layer-2 solutions.

Determining the minimum viable ePBS involves a delicate balance of these properties, necessitating a mechanism that promotes decentralization, ensures security and efficiency, maintains transparency and fairness, and reduces reliance on trust. Ongoing discussions and research within the Ethereum community are crucial for refining these concepts and moving towards a consensus on the optimal ePBS mechanism.
