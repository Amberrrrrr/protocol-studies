## Primer on Merkle Tree

Merkle tree is a hash-based data structure which is very efficient at data integrity and verification. It is a tree based structure where the leaf nodes hold the data values and each non-leaf node is a hash of its child nodes.

A Merkle tree stores all the transactions in a block by producing a digital fingerprint of the entire set of transactions. It allows the user to verify whether a transaction is included in a block or not. Merkle trees are created by repeatedly calculating hashing pairs of nodes until there is only one hash left. This hash is called the **Merkle Root**, or the Root Hash. The Merkle Trees are constructed in a bottom-up approach.

It is important to note that Merkle trees are in a **binary tree**, so it requires an even number of leaf nodes. If there is an odd number of transactions, the last hash will be duplicated once to create an even number of leaf nodes.

Merkle Trees provide a tamper-proof structure to store transaction data. Hash functions have an Avalanche Effect i.e. a small change in the data will result in a huge change in the resulting hash. Hence, if the data in the leaf nodes are ever modified, the Root Hash will not match the expected value.
You can try out [SHA-256](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha256.html) hashing function yourself as well.

Merkle Root is stored in the **Block Header**. Read more about the structure of a Block inside Ethereum (_will be linked this to relevant doc once its ready_)

The main parent node is called Root, hence the hash inside is Root Hash. There is infinitesimally small chance(1 in 1.16x10^77 for a single SHA-256 hash) to create two different states with the same root hash, and any attempt to modify state with different values will result in a different state root hash.

The image below depicts a simplified version of the working of a Merkle Tree:

- The lead nodes contain the actual data(for simplicity, we have taken numbers)
- Every non-leaf node is a hash of its children.
- The first level of non-leaf nodes contains the Hash of its child leaf nodes
  `Hash(1,2)`
- The same process continues till we reach the top of the tree, which the Hash of all the previous Hashes
  `Hash[Hash(1,2),Hash(3,4),Hash(5,6),Hash(7,8)]`

## Primer on Patricia Tree

Patricia Tries(also called Radix tree) are n-ary trees which unlike Merkle Trees,is used for storage of data instead of verification.

Simply put, Patricia Tries is a tree data structure where all the data is store in the leaf nodes, and each non-leaf nodes is a character of a unique string identifying the data. Using the unique string we navigate through the character nodes and finally reach the data. Hence, it is very efficient at data retrieval.

Patricia tries are designed to be more space-efficient than traditional trie structures by eliminating redundant nodes with single children. They achieve compactness by sharing prefixes among keys. This means that common prefixes are shared among different keys, reducing the overall storage requirements.

# Ethereum

Ethereum's primary data structure for storing the execution layer state is a **Merkle Patricia Trie** (pronounced "try"). It is named so, since it is a Merkle tree that uses features of PATRICIA (Practical Algorithm To Retrieve Information Coded in Alphanumeric), and because it is designed for efficient data retrieval of items that comprise the Ethereum state.

Ethereum state is stored in four different modified merkle patricia tries (MMPTs):

- Transaction Trie
- Receipt Trie
- World State Trie
- Storage Trie

![Tries](../../images/tries.png)

At each block there is one transaction, receipt, and state trie which are referenced by their root hashes in the block Header.
For every contract deployed on Ethereum there is a storage trie used to hold that contract's persistent variables, each storage trie is referenced by their root hash in the state account object stored in the state trie leaf node corresponding to that contract's address.
